# WinClean

## About WinClean

WinClean is a command line tool that optimizes and cleans your Windows 10 installation at any time. WinClean can even uninstall any bloatware and help you set up all your settings and install your favorite programs on a new installation. It even suggests which programs could fit your installation! 

You can run WinClean at any time and WinClean will do the rest for you, but is still makes sure that you can set up your system completely to your liking. 

## Important Notes

Please note that WinClean is still in **very early development** so many features aren't implemented yet. Check back here in a few weeks to see if there are any new updates!

Also important to mention is that WinClean doesn't have a certificate yet! That means that your computer will warn you multiple times before starting WinClean that WinClean might be unsafe. It might even mistake WinClean for malware, because WinClean has to access low-level system commands and has to run them as an administrator.

If you're unsure about downloading WinClean you can wait until we have a certificate or try it out on a virtual machine first or just look at the source code (if that's your thing :wink: )

## Features

A list of features will be added soon!

## Installing WinClean on your computer

You can install WinClean by going on to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Akjo03/WinClean/releases) where you can find every version of WinClean. We recommend to download the latest pre-release (as there are no full releases yet) unless it is explicitly stated that the release shouldn't be used. If so just choose the second-latest release.

## Learn More

If you want to learn more about WinClean you can check out our [wiki](https://github.com/Akjo03/WinClean/wiki) or our [website](https://akjo03.github.io/WinClean/).

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute.

## Deployment

If you want to deploy WinClean you can just run the deploy.bat file. This will create two files under `bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/win-x64/publish`. 

If you want to make a release you can package these two files with WinRAR into a self-extracting archive. Instructions on how to create such a self-extracting archive as intended will be available on the wiki soon. Until then please do not make a release yet unless you know how to do so (which includes more than just creating a self-extracting archive with WinRAR).
