# How to contribute

To get started, clone this repo onto your local machine and open up the sln file in Visual Studio 2019.

To start contributing either create an issue or assign an existing issue to yourself and put it into "In progress" on the associated version board.
Then create a branch off of the associated version branch (for example call the branch iss42 for issue #42) and checkout to that branch on your local machine.

Now you can start working on resolving the issue.

After you resolved the issue you can simply close the issue and it will automatically be "Done" on the version board.
The only thing left to do is to merge the issue branch back into the version branch.
